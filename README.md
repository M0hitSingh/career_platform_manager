## Testing

### Backend Tests
Test suite with Jest (models working, API routes need implementation):
```bash
cd server
npm test tests/models.test.js  # Run model tests (working)
npm run test:coverage          # Run with coverage report
npm run test:watch             # Run in watch mode
```

### End-to-End Tests
Selenium script that tests the full user flow:
```bash
pip install selenium
python test_automation_simple.py
```

### Test Coverage
- âœ… Database model validation (working)
- ðŸš§ Authentication and authorization (tests ready, routes needed)
- ðŸš§ CRUD operations for jobs and companies (tests ready, routes needed)
- ðŸš§ Career page builder functionality (tests ready, routes needed)
- ðŸš§ Public API endpoints (tests ready, routes needed)
- ðŸš§ Middleware and error handling (tests ready, routes needed)

**Note**: The test infrastructure is complete with comprehensive test cases, but the actual API route handlers need to be implemented to make all tests pass.
