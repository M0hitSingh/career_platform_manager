# AI Agent Development Log

## How I Used AI Tools

### Initial Setup
- Use PRD.doc to give detail understanding the requirement to GenAI
- Used AI to generate project task and order of developement 

### Key Prompts That Worked
- AI is best for Analysis and finding all way of implementation before start, which save time and have clear Idea
- Rather than asking random error, give path of file where error arised which the error, which reduce the token waste of AI and give clear boundry for them to search
- Always create FEATURE.md file which sumarises the current developement of each features which help better in enhancement
- In prompting use bullet points to give detail and multiple request in one go
- Use all my PRD.doc to create Selenum test script for testing flow 

### Refinements Needed
- Wrong prompt or less detail prompt lead to change huge codes which became harder to fix (Then I role back)
- Have to tell detail logics and all the edge cases which can be present for better feature development


### What I Learned
- AI is best for maintaining code and adding error handling/commnets/descriptions and feature dilvering will became faster
- Bullet points for better clarifications and steps 
- Never give a prompt which have a large scope


### Effective Patterns
- Breaking complex features into smaller components
- Iterating based prompting to reduce token waste
- Use AI to document each features for better context in future development

### Tools Used
- Kiro IDE for file management and code editing

## Key Takeaways
- AI works best with clear, specific requirements
- Real user testing reveals issues AI can't predict
- Iterative refinement beats trying to get everything perfect first time
